  <Func Arg="arg" Name="Cdd_PolyhedraByInequalities" />
 <Returns>a <Math>\texttt{CddPolyhedra}</Math> Object
</Returns>
 <Description>
The function takes a list in which every entry represents an inequality( or equality).
In case we want some entries to represent equalities we should refer
in a second list to their indices.

  <Func Arg="arg" Name="Cdd_PolyhedraByGenerators" />
 <Returns>a <Math>\texttt{CddPolyhedra}</Math> Object
</Returns>
 <Description>
The function takes a list in which every entry represents a vertex in the ambient vector space.
In case we want some vertices to be free( the vertex and its negative belong to the polyhedra) we should refer
in a second list to their indices .
