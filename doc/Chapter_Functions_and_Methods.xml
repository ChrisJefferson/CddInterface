  <Func Arg="arg" Name="Cdd_PolyhedraByInequalities" />
 <Returns>a CddPolyhedra Object
</Returns>
 <Description>
The function takes a list in which every entry represents an inequality( or equality).
In case we want some entries to represent equalities we should refer to their indices
in a second list.
