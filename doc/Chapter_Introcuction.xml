Every convex polyhedron has two representations, one as the intersection of finite halfspaces and the other as Minkowski sum of the convex hull of
finite points and the nonnegative hull of finite directions. These are called H-representation and V-representation, respectively.
<Math>\newline</Math>
Let us start by introducing the H-representation. Let <Math>A</Math> be <Math>m \times d</Math> matrix and let <Math>b</Math> be a column <Math>m</Math>-vector. The H-representation of the polyhedron defined by the system
<Math>b+Ax > 0</Math> is as follows:
